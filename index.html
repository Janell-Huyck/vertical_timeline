          <p>This is my first prject that dealt with interacting with the user.  
          The user is clicking on different buttons to 1) change the color of 
          a box, 2) increment a counter, and 3) determine if the value of that 
          counter is even or odd.  It was also my first exposure to CSS, and 
          we were given examples to follow with the color changes and making 
          the buttons.</p>

          <p>This dynamically generated multiplication table was created at 
          about the one-month mark in the Kenzie program.  It includes 
          variables, nested loops, and some basic CSS styling.  It also 
          includes my first attempts at using functions in a script.</p>

          <p>Maze is my first introduction to nested loops and my first 
          project that made extensive use of functions.  It used nested 
          arrays to model the maze itself, and a keylogger to get the 
          directional commands for the bear.  Making the project appealing 
          by adding the graphics and a very short backstory was a lot of fun.</p>

          <p>This sequel to the Maze project made even more use of 
          modeling and mapping, and had some logical puzzles for how to 
          handle things like being able to push an object but not through 
          a wall or other object.  The bear theme was continued, where 
          the objective was to push the empty jars onto the honey-comb 
          spaces.  The empty jars become full jars when placed on a honeycomb. </p>

          <p>This four-person group project involved recreating the classic board 
          game Connect Four.  When a column is clicked, a red or black piece is 
          added to the top of the column, depending on whose turn it is. 
          Winning scenarios are checked after every move for horizontal, 
          vertical, and diagonal.</p>
          <p>This was our first attempt at using Agile 
          and coordinating a git repository among multiple developers.  Chief 
          among the lessons learned would be how important it is to have 
          everyone with the same understanding of the underlying structure of 
          the project, and how important it is to NOT push a non-functioning 
          branch to the master branch so that all your teammates clone it.  LOL!</p>
          <p>My role included the overall project design, creating the table, the
          logic and implementation for placing pieces, the logic and implementation 
          for the win conditions, and quality control. </p>

          adding a like/unlike function to individual messages, adding the

          <p>This front-end capstone 7-person group project recreated the classic 
          board game Battleship.  We were given three weeks and freedom over 
          the nature and design of the project.  We chose to build an API-interacting
          game that worked off the same database framework we had used for Kwitter.  
          Two players on different computers play against eachother, taking turns 
          firing torpedos against their opponent's locations until one person has sunk
          all the opponents' ships.  Our group included a UX/UI design student, two 
          people who focused almost exclusively on the css, and the remainder worked 
          on the JavaScript.</p>
          <p>My roles in this project were the product owner and team leader. Because of
          the tight time-table, our group allowed me to come up with the overall design and
          strategy of the project and lay out the react-redux framework before the project
          start-date.  I facilitated daily standup meetings, encouraged all members' 
          participation, answered technical questions and assisted with every step of 
          the project.  No one component was exclusively mine, but I participated to some
          degree in almost everything.</p>
